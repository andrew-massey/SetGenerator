# SetGenerator
An application that randomly generates sets for Union Baptist Church's youth band. This is built in collaboration with Netrift (nercoslog.com).

# Setup
1) Via Eclipse
  For this method, it is imperative that you have the java and fxml files in a repository titled "general" inside the src folder. Also, the songList.txt file is to be placed in the root of the project directory.
2) Via command line
  As long as all of the files are in the same directory and as long as you have Java 8 installed, it should work just fine.
